The Odin Project: Project Recipes
This project is a basic recipe website and aims to showcase some of the basic HTML skills I have learned so far.
The website will consist of a main index page that has links to a few recipes.

Takeaways from this project:
- Improved at creating the HTML boilderplate
- Practiced how to incorporate links, lists, and images
- Learned how to resize images in HTML
